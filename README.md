# mi0283qt9-colloring
just something with the watterott mi0283qt9 display together with a wii nunchuck.

just place the maps in the libs in your arduino lib folder and upload Draw.ino to your arduino.

I know for shure it works on a arduino UNO with a watterott mi0283qt9 with a wii nunchuck breakout bord.
Please make shure that the wii nunchuck breakout bord is conectd to the pin A4 and A5 like you shud with the wire library.
